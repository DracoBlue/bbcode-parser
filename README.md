bbcode-parser
=============

Epochtalk BBCode Parser built specifically for Bitcointalk's BBCode (SMF Based)

This is based on the work of:  
Extendible BBCode Parser v1.0.0  
By Patrick Gillespie (patorjk@gmail.com)  
Website: http://patorjk.com/  

This is a bbcode parser that has been specifically built to read and parse the BBCode tags that come from the bitcointalk forum. Their BBCode is based off of SMF BBCode but with some modifications. It has also been modified to be used as a node module rather than a browser based library.
